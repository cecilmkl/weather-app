## SheCodes Plus Project 2021/2022

Coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript using a Weather API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and hosted on both [Netlify](https://goofy-lewin-d4e57d.netlify.app/) and [SheCodes](http://shecodes.io/workshops/shecodes-plus-d06049c3-f016-47b1-8d88-446d4f80d767/projects/670935). The weather icons used in the app were created by Sihan Liu at [iconfinder.com](https://www.iconfinder.com/Neolau1119/icon-sets).

The project was created as a part of the Plus coding workshop at [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/).
